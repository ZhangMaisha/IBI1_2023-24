Practical3
1. your file has the wrong name (thingsIlike copy.txt)
I rename the file, and delete a wrong file
2. Commit messages for Week 3 are informative>please be more rigorous
I was given this advice: I would suggest that you make some edits to one of your week 3 files and then re-commit everything. When you make this  and every new commit,  make sure that you write a distinct commit message which will help you discriminate across each event. So I did.

1. Pseudocode has been used and the code is well documented>could be more detailed
I add some pseudocode.
2. File mystery_code.py exists
I don't know why the file is missing, and I add this file.
3. Check the number of days required to exceed 90% density (it takes 5 days, but answer may be 4 as you have to come back before 90% is reached. Accept both answers)>wrong explanation
I improve my explanation.
